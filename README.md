 Project Summary :-
 
Today Electronic market is on the boost and it is that type of market which is ever growing , in electronics various types of product are present like mobile ,its accessories , television , gadgets etc. Mobile now a days is compulsory   in day today life and its neccesity of the era.
In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices. The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.

Objective :- 

 The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.

 STEPS TAKEN :

 data ingeston
 
 data cleaning
 
 data wrangling
 
 EDA
 
 data visulization
 
 feature engineering
 
 outliers
 
 Predictive Modeling:
 
    Algorithms used for predictive modeling:
    
        * 1) Logistic Regression
        
        * 2) Random Forest Classifier
        
        * 3) Decision 
        
        * 4) XG Boost Classifier

EVALUARION METRICS 

Conclusion :-

*  From EDA we can see that here are mobile phones in 4 price ranges. The number of elements is almost similar.

*  half the devices have Bluetooth, and half donâ€™t

*  there is a gradual increase in battery as the price range increases

*  Ram has continuous increase with price range while moving from Low cost to Very high cost

*  costly phones are lighter

*  RAM, battery power, pixels played more significant role in deciding the price range of mobile phone.

* form all the above experiments we can conclude that logistic regression and, XGboosting with using hyperparameters we got the best results *italicized text*
